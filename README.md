### Organization List

Because I'm lazy, I made it easy to update the organization list to get updated (estimated) member counts.

1. Get a [Meetup API Key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)
2. Export the key in your shell: `export MEETUP_API_KEY=...`
3. Edit [`orgs.rb`]('assets/orgs.rb') and add the group's URL Name
4. run `./assets/orgs.rb`, copy the output and replace it into the list.
5. Woo!
